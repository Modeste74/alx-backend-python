0x01. Python - Async

This gives an idea on what was covered in this directory.
Async and Await Syntax:
Python's async and await are used to write asynchronous code. The async keyword is used to define asynchronous functions, and await is used within these functions to call other asynchronous functions.

An example of an async function:
import asyncio

async def my_async_function():
    result = await some_other_async_function()
    return result

Executing an Async Program with asyncio:
The asyncio library in Python helps manage asynchronous code. To execute an async program:
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Your async code goes here
    await some_async_function()

# Run the event loop to execute the async code
asyncio.run(main())

Running Concurrent Coroutines:
You can run concurrent coroutines using asyncio.gather() to run multiple coroutines concurrently and await their results:

import asyncio

async def coroutine_one():
    # Some asynchronous operations
    return result_one

async def coroutine_two():
    # Some other asynchronous operations
    return result_two

async def main():
    # Run multiple coroutines concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(coroutine_one(), coroutine_two())
    # Process results here

# Run the event loop to execute the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())


Certainly! As a software engineering student diving into Python's asynchronous programming, here are explanations to help you grasp the concepts:

Async and Await Syntax:
Python's async and await are used to write asynchronous code. The async keyword is used to define asynchronous functions, and await is used within these functions to call other asynchronous functions.

An example of an async function:

python
Copy code
import asyncio

async def my_async_function():
    result = await some_other_async_function()
    return result
Executing an Async Program with asyncio:
The asyncio library in Python helps manage asynchronous code. To execute an async program:

python
Copy code
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Your async code goes here
    await some_async_function()

# Run the event loop to execute the async code
asyncio.run(main())
Running Concurrent Coroutines:
You can run concurrent coroutines using asyncio.gather() to run multiple coroutines concurrently and await their results:

python
Copy code
import asyncio

async def coroutine_one():
    # Some asynchronous operations
    return result_one

async def coroutine_two():
    # Some other asynchronous operations
    return result_two

async def main():
    # Run multiple coroutines concurrently
    results = await asyncio.gather(coroutine_one(), coroutine_two())
    # Process results here

# Run the event loop to execute the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())
Creating asyncio Tasks:
You can create tasks using asyncio.create_task() to concurrently execute coroutines:

import asyncio

async def my_coroutine():
    # Your asynchronous operations here
    return result

async def main():
    # Create tasks for coroutines
    task_one = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())
    task_two = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine())

    # Wait for tasks to complete
    await task_one
    await task_two

# Run the event loop to execute the main coroutine
asyncio.run(main())

Using the Random Module:
The random module in Python is used to generate random numbers. Here's a simple example:

import random

# Generate a random integer between 1 and 10
random_number = random.randint(1, 10)
print(random_number).
